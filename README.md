Kindle Clippings
================

A simple python script to extract clippings from `My Clippings.txt, organize, store and output them in a more elegant way.


Features

Automator workflow automatically imports the `My Clippings.txt` file and the script creates a markdown note for each item.


Usage
-----

Install the automator workflow as a folder action watching the /Volumes/ folder. Make sure to chose where it should copy your clips, and that the script is in the same folder.


To do
-----
Own notes are currently treated as highlights. Should rather be formatted to accompany the relevant highlight.
